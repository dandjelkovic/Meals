# Meals
Small meal tracking App to get in touch with SwiftUI and Apple Watch development.

The user should get an overview how often meat, vegetarian and vegan meals she or he has eaten in the past time.
In further development steps the tracking should be done mostly on the Apple Watch with reminder throughout the day.
